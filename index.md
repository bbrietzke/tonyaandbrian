Maybe you've heard and maybe you haven't, but Tonya Hartwich and Brian Brietzke are getting married on July the 14th of 2012.

Turns out, there will be a wedding and everything!  

### Who is getting married?

### When will it be?

The wedding will be held on July the 14th of 2012.  That is the second saturday in July of this year.  __Trust me__, we know that isn't that far off!

### Where will it be at?

The ceremony will be held at the [Grand Superior Lodge](http://www.grandsuperior.com/).  We haven't decided on a time yet, but it will be later in the day or early evening.

You are certainly welcome to stay at the lodge.  They do have a limited number of rooms, so book early and often.  If you would like a discount, just tell them you are a AAA member.  They don't verify the membership.

If you don't want to stay at the lodge, there should be hotels in [Two Harbors](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=hotels+in+two+harbors+mn+area) or in [Duluth](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=hotels+in+duluth+mn+area).  We're not specifically recommending any of them, just find one you like.

### How do I get there?

Walk, drive, fly, hitch hike or take the bus we don't care.

If you're flying in, the closet major airport is [Minneapolis/St.Paul Internal Airport](http://mspairport.com/).  From there, you can rent a car and [drive up to the Lodge](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=4300+Glumack+Drive+St.+Paul,+MN+55111&daddr=2826+Hwy+61+Two+Harbors+MN+55616&hl=en&sll=37.020098,-95.712891&sspn=51.351494,98.4375&geocode=FYDdrAIdq7dx-iljoBRNLCn2hzFspTwjSGJOhA%3BFZ38zgIdIsKL-inJTM1nejivUjHLgs1g2sFDGQ&vpsrc=0&mra=ls&t=m&z=8) or get a puddle jumper and fly into Duluth.  From the Duluth airport, you can rent a car and [drive to the lodge](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=4701+Grinden+Drive+Duluth,+MN+55811&daddr=2826+Hwy+61+Two+Harbors+MN+55616&hl=en&sll=45.999125,-92.357745&sspn=2.83899,6.152344&geocode=FcuyygIdcW2B-imLQKd4DLOvUjGc0cAV6FJSHw%3BFZ38zgIdIsKL-inJTM1nejivUjHLgs1g2sFDGQ&vpsrc=0&mra=ls&t=m&z=10).

If you're driving or walking from someplace else, you can find directions [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2826+Hwy+61+Two+Harbors+MN+55616&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=51.310143,98.4375&vpsrc=0&hnear=2826+Minnesota+61,+Two+Harbors,+Minnesota+55616&t=m&z=16)

If you're hitch hiking, be careful, Minnesota has a lot of serial killers.  _Seriously!_

### What can we do in Duluth?

Duluth is a cool little city on Lake Superior.  To see the sites, visit the [tourism website](http://visitduluth.com/home.php) and plan accordingly.

### What should I bring?

Yourself and a sense of humor.  If you're going to be grumpy or have a sad face, you will get reprimanded.  Three reprimands and we'll figure out what to do with you.

We would prefer that you donate to the Rabbit Rescue or to the scholarship fund, instead of bringing gifts.

### What are we doing for the wedding?

I could tell you, but that would ruin the surprise.  I'll guess you'll just have to show up and find out!
