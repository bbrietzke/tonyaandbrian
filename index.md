Maybe you've heard and maybe you haven't, but Tonya Hartwich and Brian Brietzke are getting married on July the 14th of 2012.

Turns out, there will be a wedding and everything!  

### When will it be?

The wedding will be held on July the 14th of 2012.  The wedding will start at 7PM.

### Where will it be at?

The ceremony and reception will be held at the [Grand Superior Lodge](http://www.grandsuperior.com/). 

You are certainly welcome to stay at the lodge.  We have a block of rooms reserved, so when you call to book your room mention that it's for the Hartwich/Brietzke wedding.  If you would like a discount, just tell them you are a AAA member.  They don't verify the membership.

If you don't want to stay at the lodge, there should be hotels in [Two Harbors](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=hotels+in+two+harbors+mn+area) or in [Duluth](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=hotels+in+duluth+mn+area).  We're not specifically recommending any of them, just find one you like.

This is a very touristy area so you will need to book soon or there may not rooms available.

### How do I get there?

Walk, drive, fly, hitch hike or take the bus we don't care.

If you're flying in, the closet major airport is [Minneapolis/St.Paul Internal Airport](http://mspairport.com/).  From there, you can rent a car and [drive up to the Lodge](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=4300+Glumack+Drive+St.+Paul,+MN+55111&daddr=2826+Hwy+61+Two+Harbors+MN+55616&hl=en&sll=37.020098,-95.712891&sspn=51.351494,98.4375&geocode=FYDdrAIdq7dx-iljoBRNLCn2hzFspTwjSGJOhA%3BFZ38zgIdIsKL-inJTM1nejivUjHLgs1g2sFDGQ&vpsrc=0&mra=ls&t=m&z=8) or get a puddle jumper and fly into Duluth.  From the Duluth airport, you can rent a car and [drive to the lodge](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=4701+Grinden+Drive+Duluth,+MN+55811&daddr=2826+Hwy+61+Two+Harbors+MN+55616&hl=en&sll=45.999125,-92.357745&sspn=2.83899,6.152344&geocode=FcuyygIdcW2B-imLQKd4DLOvUjGc0cAV6FJSHw%3BFZ38zgIdIsKL-inJTM1nejivUjHLgs1g2sFDGQ&vpsrc=0&mra=ls&t=m&z=10).

If you're driving or walking from someplace else, you can find directions [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2826+Hwy+61+Two+Harbors+MN+55616&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=51.310143,98.4375&vpsrc=0&hnear=2826+Minnesota+61,+Two+Harbors,+Minnesota+55616&t=m&z=16)

If you're hitch hiking, be careful, Minnesota has a lot of serial killers.  _Seriously!_

### What can we do in Duluth?

Duluth is a cool city on Lake Superior.  To see the sites, visit the [tourism website](http://visitduluth.com/home.php) and plan accordingly.

### What should I bring?

Yourself and a sense of humor.  If you're going to be grumpy or have a sad face, you will get reprimanded.  Three reprimands and we'll figure out what to do with you.

In lieu of gifts, we ask that you donate to the Rabbit Rescue (where Augustus was adopted from) or the scholarship fund in memory of the groom's mother.  You can [go here for more details][donations]

### What are we doing for the wedding?

I could tell you, but that would ruin the surprise.  I'll guess you'll just have to show up and find out!
