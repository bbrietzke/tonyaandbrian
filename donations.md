### The Rabbit Rescue

You can donate to [House Rabbit Rescue Network](http://rabbitresource.org/tonya-hartwich-and-brian-brietzkes-wedding/).  This is the place where Augustus the rabbit, our darling bunny girl, was rescued from.  There are still lots of cute little bunny girls and boys there that would love a home or just some attention.  Any donations would help them wascally wabbits out!

### Shirley Brietzke Memorial

In 2006 the groom's mother lost her fight with breast cancer.  As a memorial, Brian's family has decided to create a scholarship fund in her honor. All donations will go towards developing an endowed scholarship at southwest Texas junior college, which serves the area where she grew up and graduated high school.
