bad dream

# Part One
## Intro

New drug, sleep aid =>
Took drug at 9:30, went to bed about 11, not sure when i went to sleep
Woke screaming at 12:45

## Setup

I could tell we where kids and we had just moved into a new place to live.  the place was like an old church or a monestary.  the upstairs solarium was converted to my room and was only accessible by a ladder.  Evan a large room downstairs off of a side hallway.  My parents had smaller room off of the converted kitchen.  the living area was like the size of a basketball court and was unfinished and unfurnished.  When you went through the front door, you went down a long hallway that emptied into the converted diving/kitchen area, with the living room off to the left.

You could not hear somebody talking or screaming from any where in the building.  It was large, very cold and old.  The floors where concrete and the walls where either concrete or stone. 

# Part Two
##  Coming Home One Day

I was older.

Came home one day, maybe from work.  I turned around from locking the door and saw a figure turning at the end of the hallway.  I got down to the end of the hallway, and didn't see anybody.  There was a large quantity of work horses, hot plates, paint buckets and work equipment in the living area as if somebody was actually going to do some work to finish the living area.

I walked across the living area and down the short hallway to Evan's room.  I tried to open the door and it was locked so I knocked.  He answered, said he had been home a while and didn't know what all the equipment was in the living room.  He said he was the only one home and hadn't see our parents come back in.

I go climb the ladder to my room, but don't stay long.

## The action

Once down, I see that some of the equipment was one fire, like the hot plates had been left on to long and overheated.  I cry !FIRE! and try to look for stuff to put the fires out.  I can't find anything, so i start turning over the work horses, dumping the equipment to the ground and use some of the plywood to beat the flames into submission.  The fire is briefly worse, but eventually i extiguish it.  I start to turn down the hall to Evan's room, but instead i see him standing there.  He asks what is going on, and I yell at him asking if he'd heard me.  He hadn't and was only coming out for water.

I turn to go the parents room, to see what is going on.  I see a figure like a fransician monk with his hood pulled over his head standing at the start of the hallway. You can see through him, so he must be a ghost.

He says, "Your father is dead"

I wake screaming
